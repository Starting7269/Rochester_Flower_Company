December 24th marked 21 days since the seeds sprouted. Mostly ... one of the original seeds I selected was old and not viable so it never sprouted. This means the SpeedRun Seeds SlamBerry is 3 days younger than the other three plants as this was the strain i opted to use instead. It turned 21 days old on December 27th. Moving forward when I say a specific week I'll be speaking generally as it applies to the three plants, just keep in mind the speedurn is slightly behind.

**During week three (Dec 17-24)** - I turned on the [airpump](https://amzn.to/4pTWerN) to the roots of the plants. I'm currently using an [AutoPot system](https://amzn.to/4qog6D0) so i use the [AirBase](https://amzn.to/4ax0Tev) and [AirDome](https://amzn.to/3LdpkTI).You normally turn this on 2 or 3 weeks after enabling water feeding from the reservoir. 

I also raised my Daily Light Integral to 30. DLI is a unit of measurement for a number you try to hit of the amount of photons the plant can absorb, relative to the time you have the light on. I raised it from 20 to 30.

I also confirmed acknowledgement of a [magnesium deficiency](https://www.growweedeasy.com/cannabis-plant-problems/magnesium-deficiency). Magnesium is a mobile nutrient which means it'll affect older or lower growth first. I noticed some chlorosis on older leaves. This is a fading of the leaf color from bright green to pale green or yellow, specifically between the veins and along the edges of the leaves, while the veins remain dark green. If you grow in [coco coir](https://amzn.to/4pX8k3s) then you know to look for this and calcium issues. Coco coir
