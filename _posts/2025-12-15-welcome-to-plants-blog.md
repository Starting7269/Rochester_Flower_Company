excerpt: "Starting a blog to document what actually happens in the grow tents. The wins, the deficiencies, and everything in between."

So I'm starting this blog thing.

I've been growing in Rochester for a while now, documenting everything in spreadsheets and voice memos that nobody sees. Figured it was time to actually share what's happening in the tents - the good, the magnesium deficiencies, all of it.

This is where I'll post grow updates, strain reports, things that worked (and the many things that didn't), and whatever else comes up when you're trying to grow clean craft cannabis in upstate New York winters.

No content calendar. No posting schedule. Just real updates when there's something worth sharing.

First real post is already up - strain selection for the winter 2025 indoor garden. Four autopots, four very different cultivars, and a lot of curiosity about how this is going to play out.

Check back whenever. Or don't. The plants don't care either way, and honestly, neither do I. This is just documentation that happens to be public.
