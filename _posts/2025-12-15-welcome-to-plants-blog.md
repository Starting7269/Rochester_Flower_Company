So I'm starting this blog thing.

I've been growing in Rochester for a while now, documenting everything in spreadsheets and voice memos that nobody sees. Figured it was time to actually share what's happening in the tents - the good, the magnesium deficiencies, all of it.

This is where I'll post grow updates, strain reports, things that worked (and the many things that didn't), and whatever else comes up when you're trying to grow clean craft cannabis in upstate New York winters.

No content calendar. No posting schedule. Just real updates when there's something worth sharing.

More to come soon from the grow room.
