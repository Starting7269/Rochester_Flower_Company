December 24th marked 21 days since the seeds sprouted. Well, three of them anyway. One of the original seeds I selected was old and not viable, so it never sprouted. This means the SpeedRun Seeds SlamBerry is three days younger than the other three plants, as this was the strain I opted to use instead. It turned 21 days old on December 27th. Moving forward when I reference a specific week, I'll be speaking generally as it applies to the three plants, just keep in mind the SpeedRun is slightly behind.

**During week three (Dec 17-24)** - I turned on the [airpump](https://amzn.to/4pTWerN) to the roots of the plants. I'm currently using an [AutoPot system](https://amzn.to/4qog6D0) so I use the [AirBase](https://amzn.to/4ax0Tev) and [AirDome](https://amzn.to/3LdpkTI). You normally turn this on 2 or 3 weeks after enabling water feeding from the reservoir.

I also raised my Daily Light Integral to 30. DLI is a unit of measurement for the amount of photons the plant can absorb relative to the time you have the light on. I raised it from 20 to 30.

I also confirmed a [magnesium deficiency](https://www.growweedeasy.com/cannabis-plant-problems/magnesium-deficiency). Magnesium is a mobile nutrient which means it'll affect older or lower growth first. I noticed some chlorosis on older leaves—a fading of the leaf color from bright green to pale green or yellow, specifically between the veins and along the edges of the leaves, while the veins remain dark green.

If you grow in [coco coir](https://amzn.to/4pX8k3s) then you know to look for calcium and magnesium issues. Coco coir has a high cation exchange capacity (CEC), which causes it to bind calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) cations, making them unavailable to plants.

I was following all the rules to address this prior to it becoming an issue, or so I thought:

* Use tap water and know its contents, or use RO water and add it back. I use tap water and know the exact contents thanks to an annual county water survey provided by my water company. I also add 4ml per gallon of FloraFlex Cal \+ Mag \+ Iron out of an abundance of precaution because my tap water is not particularly hard.

* Buffer your coco coir or purchase [pre-buffered coco](https://amzn.to/3MRXywG). I purchase pre-buffered coco.

So where did I go wrong and what will I do about it? Good question. As with most things with this plant I'll try my best to address it and if I miss the mark, I'll try again. Here's my plan:

* Going to buffer my own coco even though it's pre-buffered. This is a simple task. When I buy coco it's a compact brick and I put it in a five-gallon bucket with one gallon of water to expand. Next grow I'll add 4ml CalMag to that water as a safeguard.

* Make sure I'm using fresh CalMag. I noticed my FloraFlex Cal \+ Mag \+ Iron is a couple years old. I attribute this to FloraFlex's minimum container size being one gallon. It takes a long time for a small home grower to use a gallon of CalMag. I'm going back to [General Hydroponics CALiMAGic](https://amzn.to/4stc26C) which comes in a quart, which should help ensure freshness.

I can't travel back in time so the first bullet is for the next grow and the second bullet has already been implemented. Otherwise they look great. That Papaya Bomb X Banjo from Atlas Seeds is incredibly leggy with great structure while the other three are dense and squat. Looking forward to seeing how they develop over the next weekas this should be a good growth week.
