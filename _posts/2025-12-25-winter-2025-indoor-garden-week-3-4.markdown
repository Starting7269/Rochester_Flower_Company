excerpt: Three weeks in and I'm already dealing with magnesium deficiency. Here's
  what went wrong and how I'm fixing it.

Three weeks in. Well, three weeks for three of the plants. The SlamBerry is running a few days behind after I had to replace a dud seed, but it's catching up.

Week three was all about ramping things up. I turned on the [airpump](https://amzn.to/4pTWerN) to the roots. I'm running [AutoPots](https://amzn.to/4qog6D0) with [AirBase](https://amzn.to/4ax0Tev) and [AirDome](https://amzn.to/3LdpkTI) setups, and you typically fire up the air 2-3 weeks after the reservoir starts feeding. The plants were ready for it.

I also bumped the Daily Light Integral from 16 to 20 and used DLI for all of week three. DLI is basically "total daily light dose" - more photons, more growth potential. They're big enough to handle it now.

Then there was the magnesium issue.

## The Magnesium Problem

I noticed [magnesium deficiency](https://www.growweedeasy.com/cannabis-plant-problems/magnesium-deficiency) showing up on the older leaves. Chlorosis between the veins - that telltale fade from green to pale yellow while the veins stay dark green. Magnesium is a mobile nutrient, so when the plant needs it elsewhere, it pulls from the older growth first. Classic symptom.

If you grow in [coco coir](https://amzn.to/4pX8k3s), calcium and magnesium issues are part of the deal. Coco has a high cation exchange capacity (CEC), which means it binds Ca and Mg, making them unavailable to the plants even if they're in your nutrient solution.

I thought I was doing everything right. I use tap water and I know exactly what's in it thanks to the county water survey. My tap isn't particularly hard, so I've been adding 4ml per gallon of FloraFlex Cal + Mag + Iron as insurance. I also buy [pre-buffered coco](https://amzn.to/3MRXywG) to avoid this exact problem.

So what went wrong?

## The Fix

Two things. First, I'm going to buffer my own coco from now on, even if it's sold as pre-buffered. When I rehydrate a coco brick, I put it in a five-gallon bucket with one gallon of water. Next grow, I'll add 4ml of CalMag to that gallon as a safeguard. Can't rely on the manufacturer alone.

Second, I realized my FloraFlex Cal + Mag + Iron is a couple years old. That's the problem with buying nutrients in gallon jugs when you're a small home grower - it takes forever to use them up, and by the time you're halfway through, they're past their prime. I've already switched to [General Hydroponics CALiMAGic](https://amzn.to/4stc26C) in a quart size. Fresher product, smaller container, better shelf life for my scale.

Obviously I can't go back in time and buffer this grow's coco differently, but the CalMag swap is already in effect. We'll see if it stabilizes things.

Otherwise, the plants look great. That Papaya Bomb x Banjo from Atlas Seeds is incredibly leggy with excellent structure, while the other three are staying dense and squat. Should be an interesting contrast as they develop. Week four is typically when growth really explodes, so I'm looking forward to the next update.
