excerpt: Magnesium issue mostly resolved, plants got rearranged, and LST has officially
  begun. Week four brought some real progress.

Week four is done, and things are moving in the right direction.

The magnesium deficiency from last week appears to be correcting itself. The [fresh CalMag](https://amzn.to/49wgpWV) is doing its job on three of the four plants. The Papaya Bomb x Banjo is taking a bit longer to bounce back, but the new growth is coming in clean and green. Sometimes you just have to let the plant work through it.

## The Height Problem

Speaking of that Papaya Bomb x Banjo - this thing is significantly taller than the other three plants. Not just a little taller, noticeably taller. Leggy structure, stretching for the light, exactly what you'd expect from genetics with Banjo in the mix.

The problem was placement. It was sitting in autopot #2, right in the middle-ish of the setup, and it was casting shadows on two neighboring plants. That's not ideal when you're trying to maximize light distribution across the canopy.

Solution was simple: move it to autopot #4 at the end of the line. Now it's only shading one plant instead of two, and the Chocolate Thai that took its old spot is much more height-appropriate for that position. Small adjustment, but it makes a real difference in how the light hits everyone.

## Low-Stress Training Begins

Week four also marked the start of LST - Low-Stress Training. This is where you gently manipulate the plant's structure to create a wider, more even canopy instead of letting it grow straight up like a Christmas tree.

The technique is straightforward: tuck the larger fan leaves under the canopy to expose lower nodes to direct light, then use [soft gardening wire](https://amzn.to/49mKAyJ) and [binder clips](https://amzn.to/4q0ccjY) and [LST plastic clips](https://amzn.to/4qsNNU8) to gently pull branches outward. The goal is to spread everything out horizontally, giving more bud sites access to quality light without snapping or damaging anything.

It's called "low-stress" for a reason - you're not aggressively bending or breaking anything like you would with high-stress techniques. Just steady, gentle encouragement to grow wider instead of taller.

The plants responded well. You can already see the lower nodes perking up now that they're getting direct light instead of living in the shadow of the top canopy.

**Photo:** 12 hours after LST - you can already see the branches responding.

## Reservoir and DLI

Added two more gallons to the [reservoir](https://amzn.to/3N77SAY) this week, bringing the total up to 12 gallons since the grow started. The autopots are feeding steadily, and water uptake is increasing as the plants get bigger. That's expected and right on schedule.

[DLI](https://amzn.to/4sh9VTj) stayed at 30 all week. No reason to push it higher yet - they're still in early veg and building structure. I'll ramp it up gradually as they continue to develop.

## What's Next

Week five should show noticeable results from the LST work. The canopy should start spreading out, the lower branches should start catching up in height, and overall structure should start looking more intentional and less "houseplant that got too tall."

The magnesium issue should be fully behind us by next update, and I'm curious to see how much that Papaya Bomb x Banjo continues to stretch now that it's not fighting for position in the middle of the tent.

The other three plants - Head Zeppelin, SlamBerry, and Chocolate Thai - are all staying compact and bushy. That's going to make for an interesting contrast as we head into flower in a few weeks.

More from the tents soon.
