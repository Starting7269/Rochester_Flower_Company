excerpt: Week five brought increased light intensity, environmental adjustments, and
  some strategic defoliation. The plants are responding beautifully.

Week five is done, and the plants are thriving.

This was the week where everything started feeling dialed in. The LST work from last week is paying off, the magnesium issue is completely behind us, and the canopy is developing exactly how it should. Time to push things a bit harder.

## Continued Training and Maintenance

Leaf tucking continued throughout the week. As the plants grow, larger fan leaves naturally shade lower bud sites, so tucking them under the canopy keeps everything exposed to direct light. It's a daily task at this stage, but it makes a real difference in how evenly the canopy develops.

We also did some light defoliation this week. Not aggressive, just removing a few of the lowest fan leaves that were sitting on the coco surface or blocking airflow at the base of the plants. The goal isn't to strip the plant, it's to improve air circulation and remove leaves that aren't contributing much photosynthesis anyway.

**Photo:** Before defoliation - dense lower canopy blocking airflow.

**Photo:** After defoliation - improved airflow and cleaner structure.

The plants handled it well. No stress, no slowed growth, just cleaner structure and better airflow through the canopy.

## Environmental Adjustments

[DLI](https://amzn.to/3Z1ATAI) got bumped from 30 to 40 this week. The plants are big enough now to handle more light intensity, and you can see them responding to it. Growth is noticeably faster, internodal spacing is tight, and the leaves are staying healthy and green under the increased photon load.

We also shifted VPD to late veg / early flower targets. VPD, Vapor Pressure Deficit, is the relationship between temperature, humidity, and how efficiently the plant can transpire. Late veg calls for slightly different targets than early veg, so we adjusted the environmental controls accordingly. The plants are transpiring well and showing no signs of stress from the change.

Added 10 gallons to the reservoir this week, bringing the total water consumption since the start to 22 gallons. Water uptake is increasing as expected - bigger plants, more transpiration, more solution being pulled through the [autopot system](https://amzn.to/3NdO5Qn).

## Plant Health and Observations

The plants look exceptional. Beautiful deep green, no signs of deficiency, no signs of toxicity. The new CalMag is doing its job, the schedule is working, and the environmental conditions are right where they need to be.

The grow room is starting to smell like plants, that fresh, green, living smell that comes from healthy vegetation actively growing. It's not terpenes yet, just the smell of chlorophyll and plant respiration. It's a good sign. Means everything is functioning the way it should.

All four cultivars are developing their own personalities. The Papaya Bomb x Banjo is still the tallest and leggiest, but the LST is keeping it manageable. Head Zeppelin, SlamBerry, and Chocolate Thai are staying compact and bushy with excellent structure. Should make for an interesting contrast when flower kicks in.

## What's Next

Week six will likely be the last week of pure vegetative growth before we start seeing early flower signs on the three smaller siblings. Papaya Bomb x Banjo is more mature in the process. Autoflowers transition on their own schedule, and we're right at that window. The plan is to bump DLI at 45, continue daily maintenance and leaf tucking, and watch for the first signs of pre-flowers.

Once flowering starts, the real work begins. But for now, we're right where we need to be, healthy plants, dialed environment, and everything trending in the right direction.

More from the tents soon.
