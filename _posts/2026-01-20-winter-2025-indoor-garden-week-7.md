Week seven is wrapped, and the tent is absolutely packed.

The plants are beautiful, healthy, and filling every available inch of space. At this rate, we're looking at a serious harvest. Everything that's been dialed in over the past six weeks is paying off now that flower is in full swing.

## Under Canopy Lighting

Last week I mentioned adding under canopy lighting, and this week it finally got installed. The goal is simple: get photons to the lower bud sites that the main overhead light can't reach through the dense upper canopy.

Without supplemental lighting below, you risk developing larf - those small, airy buds at the bottom of the plant that don't get enough light to properly develop. Under canopy lighting helps prevent that by ensuring even the lower nodes get quality light exposure.

The setup is straightforward. LED bars positioned below the SCROG net, angled to hit the sides and undersides of the plants. Not as intense as the overhead light, but enough to make a real difference in lower bud development.

Results won't be visible for a few weeks, but the goal is to maximize usable flower across the entire plant instead of just harvesting quality tops and throwing away the bottom third.

## Defoliation Round Two

By mid-week, the canopy was so dense you couldn't see through it. Literally. The SCROG net was doing its job spreading things out horizontally, but the sheer volume of leaves was blocking light penetration and restricting airflow.

**Photo:** Before defoliation - canopy too dense for light or air to penetrate.

That's a problem for multiple reasons. First, bud sites below the canopy can't develop if they're not getting light. Second, stagnant air creates micro-climates inside the canopy where humidity builds up and mold risk increases. Third, the plants are actively transpiring and need airflow to function efficiently.

So another round of defoliation happened. Not stripping them bare, just removing enough fan leaves to open up light pathways and restore airflow through the canopy. The focus was on leaves blocking bud sites or creating dense pockets where air couldn't move.

**Photo:** All the leaves removed during this defoliation session.

The difference is immediately visible. Light penetrates, air moves, and you can actually see the developing bud structure now instead of just a wall of green. The plants handled it well - no stress, no slowdown, just cleaner structure and better environmental conditions.

## Plant Observations

The SlamBerry caught up. She's now as tall as the Papaya Bomb x Banjo, which is saying something considering how leggy the Banjo has been from the start. The SlamBerry stretched hard during the first couple weeks of flower and is now sitting at the same canopy height.

Interesting to see the different growth patterns playing out. The Banjo has been tall and sativa-dominant since week one, steady and consistent. The SlamBerry stayed compact during veg, then exploded vertically once flower kicked in. Different strategies, same result.

All four plants are healthy and green. No deficiencies, no toxicities, no signs of stress. The CalMag issue from early veg is long behind us, and the nutrient schedule is dialed in for flower. Everything's trending exactly where it needs to be.

## Environment and Water

DLI remains at 45. No reason to change it - the plants are handling the light intensity perfectly, and without CO2 supplementation there's no benefit to pushing higher.

Added 12 gallons to the reservoir this week, bringing total water consumption to 42 gallons since the grow started. Water uptake continues to increase as the plants get bigger and transpiration ramps up in flower. The autopot system is keeping up without issue.

VPD is staying in the late veg / early flower range. Humidity and temperature are both dialed in, and the plants are transpiring efficiently. No environmental stress, no surprises, just steady growth.

## What's Next

The next few weeks will bring serious bud development. We're past the stretch phase now, so vertical growth should slow down and energy will redirect into flower production. That's when you really start to see what each cultivar is made of.

The under canopy lighting will be running for the duration of flower, and we'll see if it makes a difference in preventing larf when harvest time comes. The defoliation should hold for a while, but if the canopy gets too dense again, we'll address it.

For now, everything is exactly where it should be. Healthy plants, dialed environment, and a bumper crop taking shape.

More from the tents soon.
