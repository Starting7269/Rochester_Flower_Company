Week eight is done. Day 56 from sprout.

We're in the home stretch now. Buds are filling out, trichomes are stacking, and the finish line is visible. Each plant is showing its personality in flower, and the differences are becoming more pronounced as they mature. Harvest is probably 2-3 weeks out, depending on how the trichomes develop from here.

## Papaya Bomb x Banjo - The Early Finisher

The Papaya Bomb x Banjo continues to look beautiful and frosty. Trichome coverage is excellent, and the current scent profile is almost like Fruity Pebbles - sweet, fruity, with a little funk underneath. That said, it's still early and terpenes can shift significantly in the final weeks, so we'll see where it lands.

There's some slight yellowing showing up on the fan leaves, which could be early senescence. This plant matured faster than the others, so it makes sense that it's starting to fade a bit earlier. Not a deficiency, just the natural process of the plant shifting energy from foliage to flower production as it approaches maturity.

## SlamBerry - Thickening Up

The SlamBerry is looking great. Buds are starting to thicken noticeably, and the structure is staying compact and dense. This one stretched hard early in flower but has been focusing all its energy on bud development for the past few weeks.

The SlamBerry's trichome production is solid, and it's developing that heavy, resinous feel when you touch the sugar leaves. No signs of stress, no issues, just steady progress toward finish.

## Head Zeppelin and Chocolate Thai - Different Timelines

The Head Zeppelin is doing its thing. Healthy, happy, right on schedule. No drama, no issues, just consistent development. This plant has been low-maintenance from start to finish, and it's showing.

The Chocolate Thai is plugging along, but this one's a little different. This plant is so close to landrace origin that I almost didn't grow it indoors. I should have gone with my instinct. The Chocolate Thai would have been happier in soil and sun rather than coco and LEDs.

It'll still produce great flower when it's finished, but I can tell this plant would have preferred outdoor growing conditions. Some genetics are just built for natural light and living soil, and the Chocolate Thai is one of them. Lesson learned for next time.

## Environment and Maintenance

I cleaned out the reservoir this week to prevent biofilm buildup. I use Hypochlorous Acid in the water to help with sterilization, but the reservoir still needs to be flushed and sanitized every 2-3 weeks. It's not complicated - just drain it, scrub it down, rinse, and refill. Keeps the system clean and prevents any issues with root health or nutrient uptake.

Added 8 gallons this week, bringing total water consumption to 50 gallons since sprout. That's just shy of a full gallon per day if we average it out. With four plants, that's around a quarter gallon per plant per day. Water uptake should plateau soon as the plants shift focus from growth to ripening.

DLI is staying at 45, and relative humidity is holding at 50%. Environmental conditions are dialed in for late flower. Not much longer now - probably 2-3 weeks until harvest, depending on how the trichomes develop. We'll be watching them closely from here on out.

The next update will likely show significant changes as the plants move through the final ripening phase. That's when buds really pack on weight and terpenes finalize. Almost there.

More from the tents soon.
