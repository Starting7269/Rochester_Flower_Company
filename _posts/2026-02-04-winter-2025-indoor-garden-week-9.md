Week nine is in the books. We're getting very close now.

The plants are deep into late flower, buds are dense and heavy with trichomes, and harvest prep is underway. Each cultivar is showing its final form, and the differences between them are stark. Here's where each one stands as we head into the final stretch.

## Papaya Bomb x Banjo

The Papaya Bomb x Banjo is leading the pack toward finish. The fade is progressing naturally, trichome coverage is exceptional, and the fruity scent profile is holding strong. This one's going to be ready first.

**Photo:** Papaya Bomb x Banjo - dense, frosty, and fading naturally.

The buds are rock solid, and you can see the resin production clearly. This plant matured fast from the beginning and hasn't slowed down. Probably another week, maybe less, depending on how the trichomes look under the scope.

## SlamBerry

SlamBerry is right behind the Banjo, and the buds are looking great. Dense structure, good trichome development, and that compact indica build paying off in bud density.

**Photo:** SlamBerry - thick buds with heavy resin production.

Quick note on this photo - there's a piece of fuzz on the bud. I considered removing it and retaking the shot, but I left it because this type of stuff happens. Those plants are sticky, and things stick to them. I did remove the fuzz from the actual bud later, but the photo stays as is. It's a reminder that this is a real grow, not a photoshoot.

## Head Zeppelin

Head Zeppelin continues to be steady and reliable. No drama, no issues, just consistent development all the way through. The buds are tight, frosty, and heavy.

**Photo:** Head Zeppelin - classic structure with excellent trichome production.

This cultivar has been low-maintenance from start to finish, and it's showing in the quality of the flower. Night Owl genetics doing what they do best - delivering consistent, high-quality results.

## Chocolate Thai

The Chocolate Thai is still going. This one's taking its time, which isn't surprising given how close it is to landrace genetics. Sativas don't rush, and this plant is no exception.

**Photo:** Chocolate Thai - slower finish but developing well.

The buds are airy compared to the indica-dominant plants, which is expected. This one would have been happier outdoors, but it'll still produce quality flower. Just on its own timeline.

## Water and Environment

Added 6 gallons to the reservoir this week, bringing total water consumption to 56 gallons since sprout. Water uptake is starting to plateau as the plants shift focus from growth to ripening.

DLI is still at 45, humidity holding steady. The environment is dialed for the final push, and everything's running smoothly.

## What's Next

I'm getting the drying tent set up and sanitized. More on that in the next update, but harvest is close enough that it's time to prep the infrastructure. The drying environment is just as important as the growing environment, and it deserves the same attention to detail.

Depending on trichome development, we're probably looking at harvest within the next 7-10 days for the Banjo and SlamBerry, with Head Zeppelin a few days behind that, and Chocolate Thai bringing up the rear.

The finish line is in sight.

More from the tents soon.
