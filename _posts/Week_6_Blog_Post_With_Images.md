Week six is in the books, and the plants are officially transitioning into early flower.

This was a big week for structural changes. The canopy needed management, light intensity hit its maximum, and one plant in particular is really starting to show what it's made of. Things are getting interesting.

## Light Intensity Maxed Out

DLI got bumped to 45 this week. That's as high as I'm comfortable pushing it without supplementing CO2. The plants are handling it well - no signs of light stress, no bleaching, just steady growth and tight internodal spacing.

Without CO2 supplementation, there's a ceiling to how much light a plant can effectively use. Push it too hard and you risk diminishing returns or outright stress. At 45 DLI, we're right at that optimal zone for air exchange only.

## Installing the SCROG Net

The three shorter plants - Head Zeppelin, SlamBerry, and Chocolate Thai - got SCROGged this week. SCROG stands for Screen of Green, and it's exactly what it sounds like: a horizontal trellis net that the plants grow through.

The benefits are straightforward. First, it flattens the canopy for even light distribution across all the tops. Second, it spreads out the branches to expose more bud sites to direct light instead of letting them stack vertically. Third, it provides structural support once buds start getting heavy and branches need help carrying the weight.

The Papaya Bomb x Banjo didn't get SCROGged because she's already taller than the net would be useful for. Her height and leggy structure mean she's managing her own canopy naturally. The other three needed the help.

Within 48 hours, you could see the plants responding. Branches that were growing vertically started spreading horizontally through the net squares, and lower bud sites that were shaded suddenly had clear access to the light. It's one of those techniques where the results are visible almost immediately.

## The Papaya Bomb x Banjo Personality

Speaking of the Papaya Bomb x Banjo, she's really developing her own personality in the tent.

From the start, she's been leggy and tall - the sativa side of her genetics on full display while her sisters show their indica heritage. But it's more than just structure. Touching her stalk releases this great smell, and brushing against her sugar leaves leaves a resinous tack on my gloves that the other plants aren't producing yet.

She's got presence. Not just height, but character. You can tell this one's going to be different.

I pulled a couple leaves off her this week because they were shading some great looking bud sites and daily tucking wasn't cutting it anymore. Sometimes you just need to make the call and remove what's blocking progress. It's important to constantly take stock of your garden and adjust as needed.

## Reservoir and What's Next

Added 8 gallons to the autopot reservoir this week, bringing the total water consumption since the start to 30 gallons. Water uptake continues to increase as the plants grow and transpiration ramps up heading into flower.

The final tweak I'll be adding this coming week is under-canopy lighting. I'll talk more about that in the next update, but the goal is to get some photon penetration to the lower bud sites that the main light can't reach through the canopy. Should help with overall yield and prevent the dreaded larf at the bottom of the plant.

For now, the environment is dialed, the structure is set, and early flower is officially underway. The next few weeks should bring serious bud development and the real test of whether all this training work pays off.

More from the tents soon.
