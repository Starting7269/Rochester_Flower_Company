          Rochester Flower Company isn't a brand or a business. It's just one grower in Rochester, NY working in small batches to make good flower accessible to people who genuinely rely on it.
        </p>
        <p class="subtitle">
          No storefront, no hype. Just plants, craft, and community.

        <div class="story-content">
          <h2>Why this exists</h2>
          <p>
            This started because I saw people in my life struggling to afford the thing that helped them function, sleep, heal, or feel like themselves. Meanwhile, the legal market flooded with corporate branding, high prices, and flower that didn't feel like medicine.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some commercial growers don't dry, cure, or store properly. They let the terpenes off-gas, then spray synthetic terpenes back on to fake quality. That's not medicine. That's not cool.
          </p>
          <p>
            So I grow the way I wish the world grew: small batches, clean inputs, honest curing, no shortcuts, and no sales. Just trustworthy flower, shared responsibly with adults who need it.

        <div class="principles">
          <div class="principle-card">
            <h3>🌱 Small Batch</h3>
            <p>I typically run 2-4 plants per cycle. Good cannabis isn't made at scale. It comes from attention.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="principle-card">
            <h3>🔬 Clean Environment</h3>
            <p>Indoor tents, coco/perlite, tuned LEDs, and obsessive environmental management. Everything is intentional.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="principle-card">
            <h3>⏱️ Proper Cure</h3>
            <p>Slow dry, real cure. Fast drying ruins good work, so every harvest gets the time it deserves.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="principle-card">
            <h3>🎯 No Ego, No Hype</h3>
            <p>I don't compete, I don't chase trends. I just grow because it helps people and because I love it.</p>

          <h3>🎁 Everything is gifted, not sold</h3>
          <p>
            New York law allows adults 21+ to gift cannabis to other adults without payment, trades, services, or anything of value involved. I follow that fully.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-sm">
            <strong>I don't:</strong> sell cannabis, run a commercial operation, offer medical advice, diagnose, treat, or prescribe.

            <strong>I do:</strong> run a home garden that I take seriously, work hard on, and am proud to share with people who truly benefit from it.

        <p>
          I operate exclusively in Rochester, NY and surrounding areas where I can personally verify compliance and build genuine relationships. This isn't scalable, and that's intentional. This is a garden, not a distribution network.

          <p>
            It's just me: a husband, a pet dad, a spreadsheet addict, and a slightly obsessive plant nerd. What started as a hobby became a personal mission. Grow the best flower I can, share it responsibly, and make the whole thing feel human again.
          </p>
          <p>
            Everything you see comes from one pair of hands, in one home, in one city.

        <h2>What's next</h2>
        <p>
          I don't have plans to scale or turn this into something commercial. The goal is simple: keep the garden healthy, keep learning, keep helping, and keep sharing.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I could dream for a moment, I'd love to see my passion for helping animals and providing medicinal plants collide. Imagine craft flower grown using composted output from rescued animals, with proceeds feeding and caring for those animals. That's a world I want to live in.
