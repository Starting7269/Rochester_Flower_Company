        Rochester Flower Company isn't a brand or a business. It's just one grower in Rochester, NY 
        working in small batches to make good flower accessible to people who genuinely rely on it. 
        No storefront, no hype – just plants, craft, and community.
      </p>

  <!-- How it started -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>How this all started</h2>
      <p>
        This didn't begin as a "project." It started because I saw people in my life struggling to afford 
        the thing that helped them function, sleep, heal, or feel like themselves. Meanwhile, the legal market 
        flooded with corporate branding, high prices, and flower that didn't feel like medicine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's a fun fact: Did you know that commercial growers who didn't dry, cure, and store their bud properly, 
        allowing the terpenes off-gas, they have a synthetic spray they put on the flower to fool the buyer into thinking the 
        plant is higher quality than it actually is. Not cool, not cool at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I decided to grow the way I wish the world grew: small batches, clean inputs, honest curing, 
        no shortcuts, and no sales – just trustworthy flower, shared responsibly with adults who need it.

      <h2>What I believe in</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Small batch:</strong> Good cannabis isn't made at scale. It comes from attention, the kind you only get when the entire grow is in the hands of one person.</li>
        <li><strong>Clean environments:</strong> Indoor tents, coco/perlite, tuned LEDs, and obsessive environmental management. Temp, humidity, VPD, DLI. Everything is intentional.</li>
        <li><strong>Slow dry, real cure:</strong> Fast drying ruins good work. Every harvest gets the time it deserves so the terpene profile actually survives long enough to be appreciated.</li>
        <li><strong>No ego, no hype:</strong> I don't compete, I don't chase trends, and I don't pretend this is a business. I just grow because it helps people and because I love it.</li>
      </ul>

  <!-- What this is -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>What this is (and isn't)</h2>
      <p>
        Everything I grow is <strong>gifted</strong>, not sold. New York law allows adults 21+ to gift cannabis 
        to other adults – without payment, trades, services, or anything of value involved. I follow that fully.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't sell cannabis.<br>
        I don't run a commercial operation.<br>
        I don't offer medical advice.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a home garden, one I take seriously, work hard on, and am proud to share with people who truly benefit from it.

      <h2>Who this is for</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>People who use cannabis as real medicine</li>
        <li>People who appreciate well-grown flower</li>
        <li>People who value honesty and transparency</li>
        <li>People who can't always afford dispensary prices</li>

      <h2>The human behind the plants</h2>
      <p>
        It's just me: a husband, a pet dad, a spreadsheet addict, and a slightly obsessive plant nerd. What started as a hobby became a personal mission: grow the best flower I can, 
        share it responsibly, and make the whole thing feel human again.
      </p>
      <p>
        One day I might put more of myself here. Photos, stories, the journey. But for now, just know that everything you see comes from one pair of hands, in one home, in one city.

      <h2>Where to go next</h2>
      <p>
        I don't have big plans to scale or turn this into something commercial. The goal is simple: keep the garden healthy, keep learning, keep helping, and keep sharing. If I were allowed to 
        dream for a moment, I'd love to see my passion for helping animals and providing medicinal plants to people collide. Imagine craft flower grown using composted "output" 💩 from 
        rescued animals, and the profit from the flower pays to feed and care for those animals. That seems like a rad world that I want to live in.

        Thanks for being here. Truly.
