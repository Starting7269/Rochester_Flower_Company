        <h1>About Rochester Flower Company</h1>
        <p>
          This isn’t a brand launch. It’s just my home grow, a lot of love, and some flower
          that keeps landing in the hands of people who need it.

        <h2>Hi — I’m the grower</h2>
        <p>
          Rochester Flower Company is the fancy name I gave to my overbuilt home grow in  
          Rochester, NY. It’s small, personal, and run with a mix of spreadsheets, timers,  
          and a slightly ridiculous amount of care.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like to say: my shadow touches more than my hand. I notice everything — leaf curl,  
          air flow, plant posture — and only intervene when the plants actually need something.
        </p>

        <p>
          I started RFC because I kept running into people using cannabis as medicine — for  
          sleep, pain, anxiety, appetite — but often having to choose between bills or buds.  
          That didn’t feel right.
        </p>
        <p>
          On top of cost, lots of commercial grows use inputs that felt… grim. Chemicals,  
          questionable pesticides, possible heavy-metal residue. Once you start paying  
          attention, it gets harder to feel good about that ending up in someone’s jar.
        </p>

        <h2>What I actually do</h2>
        <p>
          A few times a year I run a small, carefully dialed-in grow. When it's harvest time,  
          the flower gets trimmed, cured, and quietly gifted to adults who genuinely need  
          medicine — no fanfare, no menu, no markup.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>No online store.</li>
          <li>No price list.</li>
          <li>No “drops.”</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Just plants, people, and a little bit of mutual aid.
        </p>

        <h2>What matters to me</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>People first</strong> — The point is to help someone get through a rough night or a rough day.</li>
          <li><strong>Craft over hype</strong> — Clean inputs, consistent process, and trust over trends.</li>
          <li><strong>Honesty</strong> — Clear about what this is and what it isn’t. No pretending to be a dispensary.</li>
          <li><strong>Respect</strong> — For the plant, for the law, and for the folks who trust me with their medicine.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Important note (the non-fun but necessary part)</h2>
        <p class="notice">
