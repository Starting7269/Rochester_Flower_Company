  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Why Cannabis?</h2>
  <p class="text-lg mb-4">
    When I was much younger, I was diagnosed with a chronic neurological condition. For years, I was stuck in a cycle of prescription medications—some prescribed just to manage the side effects of others. It felt like a never-ending nesting doll of drugs. Even at a young age, I could sense that this approach was deeply flawed.
  </p>
  <p class="text-lg mb-4">
    At the time, cannabis was still classified as a Schedule I drug by the DEA, and states like California were only beginning to explore its potential for medicinal use. Meanwhile, other countries outside the U.S. were seeing real success treating my condition with THC and CBD. That led to a very honest conversation with my neurologist. To paraphrase his words: “I can't tell you to break federal law, but if we were in a country where cannabis was legal, I would absolutely recommend it for you.”
  </p>
  <p class="text-lg mb-4">
    So we started the process of tapering off the prescription drugs. I transitioned to using cannabis as my primary treatment—and I felt better than I ever had. That experience changed everything for me. It opened my eyes to the reality that the government wasn’t prioritizing my well-being; they were protecting pharmaceutical interests.
  </p>
  <p class="text-lg mb-8">
    That realization lit a fire in me—a lifelong mission to cultivate and share the best medicine the world is still waking up to: cannabis.
