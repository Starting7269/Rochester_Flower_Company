        <h1>About Rochester Flower Company</h1>
        <p>
          This isn’t a brand launch. It’s just my home grow, a lot of love,
          and some flower that keeps finding its way into the hands of people who need it.

        <h2>Hi. I’m the grower.</h2>
        <p>
          Rochester Flower Company is basically the fancy name I gave to my deeply overbuilt
          home grow in Rochester, NY. It’s small, personal, and very much powered by spreadsheets,
          timers, and a slightly ridiculous amount of care.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started RFC because I kept meeting people who used cannabis as medicine—sleep,
          pain, anxiety, appetite—and then had to play “which bill do I not pay this month”
          to afford it. That didn’t sit right with me.
        </p>

        <h2>What I actually do</h2>
        <p>
          A few times a year, I run small, carefully dialed-in grows. When a harvest is ready,
          the flower gets trimmed, cured, and then quietly gifted to adults who genuinely need it
          and can’t easily afford consistent, safe supply.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>No online store.</li>
          <li>No price list.</li>
          <li>No “drops.”</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Just plants, people, and a little bit of mutual aid.
        </p>

        <h2>Things I care about</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>People first</strong> – The whole point is to make someone’s day/life a bit easier.</li>
          <li><strong>Craft over hype</strong> – Clean inputs, consistent process, no “mystery bag” energy.</li>
          <li><strong>Honesty</strong> – Clear about what this is and what it isn’t. No pretending to be a dispensary.</li>
          <li><strong>Respect</strong> – For the law, for the plant, and for the folks who trust me with their medicine.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Important notes (the non-fun but necessary part)</h2>
        <p class="notice">
