        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>
          Rochester Flower Company is a personal, small-scale cultivation project based in Rochester, New York.
          It started with a simple idea: <strong>medicine shouldn’t be out of reach for the people who rely on it most.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          This is not a commercial operation. There’s no storefront, no checkout, no shopping cart.
          Just a grower who loves plants, science, and helping people who genuinely benefit from cannabis.
        </p>

        <h2>What We Do</h2>
        <p>
          We grow limited runs of high-quality cannabis using clean inputs, controlled environments,
          and a craft-first mindset. When harvest comes, the flower is gifted to adults who:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use cannabis as part of their wellness or pain-management routine, and</li>
          <li>Struggle to afford consistent, dispensary-priced products.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Every gram is gifted—not sold—and always with discretion and respect.
        </p>

        <h2>Values</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Compassion</strong> – People first, always.</li>
          <li><strong>Craft</strong> – Small batches, careful hands, serious attention to detail.</li>
          <li><strong>Transparency</strong> – Clear about what we are and what we are not.</li>
          <li><strong>Respect</strong> – For the plant, the law, and the people we serve.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Important Notes</h2>
        <p class="notice">
          Rochester Flower Company does not sell cannabis products. All cannabis is gifted
          free of charge to adults 21+ only. We do not make medical claims or offer medical advice.
          Please consult a licensed healthcare professional about your health and treatment options.
