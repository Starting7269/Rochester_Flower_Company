      <h1>About Rochester Flower Company</h1>
      <p>
        This isn’t a brand or a business. It’s just one grower in Rochester, NY doing small-batch craft cannabis 
        with intention, patience, and care — and quietly sharing it with adults who genuinely benefit from it.
      </p>
    </div>

  <!-- Who I am -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container narrow">
      <h2>Hi, I’m the grower</h2>
      <p>
        Rochester Flower Company is the name I slapped onto my overbuilt home grow — a couple of tents, too many 
        spreadsheets, and a slightly obsessive attention to detail. I’m not a team, not a brand, not a company. Just a 
        person who grows small batches of clean, reliable flower.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started RFC because I kept meeting people who used cannabis the same way others use an inhaler, a sleep aid, 
        or a heating pad — as real medicine — yet were constantly priced out or forced to settle for questionable quality.
      </p>
      <p>
        And honestly? A lot of commercial flower didn’t feel great. Heavy salts, questionable pesticides, whatever 
        happened in transit… once you start paying attention to how it’s grown, it’s hard to unsee.

  <!-- What I do -->
  <section class="section section-alt">
    <div class="container narrow">
      <h2>What I actually do</h2>
      <p>
        A few times a year, I run a carefully dialed-in indoor grow. When harvest comes, the flower is slow dried, 
        properly cured, and quietly gifted to adults who truly use cannabis for relief — no storefront, no drops, no hype.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>No online shop.</li>
        <li>No pricing.</li>
        <li>No “product launches.”</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Just plants, people, and a small bit of mutual aid.
      </p>

      <h2>What matters to me</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>People first</strong> — This project exists to help someone sleep, relax, ease pain, or get through a hard day.</li>
        <li><strong>Craft over hype</strong> — Clean inputs, consistency, and transparency matter more than trends.</li>
        <li><strong>Honesty</strong> — I’ll always be clear about what this is and what it isn’t. I’m not pretending to be a dispensary.</li>
        <li><strong>Respect</strong> — For the plant, for the law, and for the people who trust me with their medicine.</li>

  <section class="section section-alt">
    <div class="container narrow">
      <h2>What this actually costs</h2>
      <p>
        Running a proper indoor grow isn’t cheap. Between seeds, nutrients, supplements, electricity, coco/perlite, 
        water treatment, and consumables, each indoor plant costs roughly <strong>$150–$200</strong> to grow — not counting 
        the original ~$2,000 equipment investment.
      </p>
      <p>
        I typically run 12–16 indoor plants a year, putting annual indoor costs somewhere between <strong>$1,800 and $3,200</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outdoor plants are cheaper but far riskier. Weather, pests, mold, bad luck — I’ve lost whole plants and entire 
        seasons. Outdoor runs average <strong>$50–$75 per plant</strong>, or about <strong>$300–$450</strong> annually.

  <!-- Legality -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container narrow">
      <h2>Is this legal?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes — entirely. New York law allows adults 21+ to <strong>gift</strong> up to 3 ounces of cannabis flower or 1 ounce of 
        concentrate to another adult 21+. There can be no payment, trades, exchanges of value, or reciprocal favors involved. 
        Gifting must occur only in places where possession is legal.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is all established under the MRTA and codified in 
        <a href="https://www.nycourts.gov/courthelp/pdfs/PenalLawArticle_222.pdf#:~:text=,four%20grams%20of%20concentrated%20cannabis"
