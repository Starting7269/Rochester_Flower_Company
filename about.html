        <h1>About Rochester Flower Company</h1>
        <p>
          This isn’t a brand launch. It’s just my home grow, a lot of love, and some flower
          that keeps landing in the hands of people who need it.

        <h2>Hi, I’m the grower</h2>
        <p>
          Rochester Flower Company is the fancy name I gave to my overbuilt home grow in  
          Rochester, NY. It’s small, personal, and run with a mix of spreadsheets, timers,  
          and a slightly ridiculous amount of care.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like to say: my shadow touches more than my hand. I notice everything; leaf curl,  
          air flow, plant posture, and only intervene when the plants actually need something.
        </p>

        <p>
          I started RFC because I kept running into people using cannabis as medicine, for  
          sleep, pain, anxiety, appetite, but often having to choose between bills or buds.  
          That didn’t feel right.
        </p>
        <p>
          On top of cost, lots of commercial grows use inputs that felt… grim. Chemicals,  
          questionable pesticides, possible heavy-metal residue. Once you start paying  
          attention, it gets harder to feel good about that ending up in someone’s jar.
        </p>

        <h2>What I actually do</h2>
        <p>
          A few times a year I run a small, carefully dialed-in grow. When it's harvest time,  
          the flower gets trimmed, cured, and quietly gifted to adults who genuinely need  
          medicine — no fanfare, no menu, no markup.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>No online store.</li>
          <li>No price list.</li>
          <li>No “drops.”</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Just plants, people, and a little bit of mutual aid.
        </p>

        <h2>What matters to me</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>People first</strong> — The point is to help someone get through a rough night or a rough day.</li>
          <li><strong>Craft over hype</strong> — Clean inputs, consistent process, and trust over trends.</li>
          <li><strong>Honesty</strong> — Clear about what this is and what it isn’t. No pretending to be a dispensary.</li>
          <li><strong>Respect</strong> — For the plant, for the law, and for the folks who trust me with their medicine.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>How much does this cost?</h2>
        <p>
          Quite a bit. This is the less glamorous side of the project. Each indoor plant costs approximately $150–$200 when you 
          factor in seeds, nutrients, supplements, electricity, grow medium, pH adjustments, and other consumables. This figure 
          excludes my initial equipment investment of about $2,000 and any labor. I typically grow around 12-16 indoor plants per year, so 
          assuming no equipment failures, my indoor grow costs fall between $1,800 and $3,200 annually. More likely closer to the $3k.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outdoor grows are cheaper but much riskier. I’ve lost full plants and entire crops to things that never happen indoors. Each 
          outdoor plant costs about $50–$75, so with six plants a year, I spend roughly $300–$450. 
        </p>
        <h2>Is this legal?</h2>
        <p>
          Doh! I knew I was forgetting something—just kidding. Yes, this is completely legal. Adults 21 and over may gift another adult 21 or older up to 3 ounces (84 grams) of cannabis flower or 1 ounce (24 grams) of concentrate. There can be no payment, trade, exchange of value, or reciprocal favors involved. The transfer must occur in a place where cannabis possession is legal (so not in schools or similar restricted locations).

            All of this is established by the MRTA and codified in NY Penal Law § 222.05
          </a>
