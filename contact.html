        <p>
          If you rely on cannabis to get through the day but the price tag keeps fighting you,
          you’re exactly the kind of person I had in mind when I built this grow.

          There’s no big intake form here on purpose. I’d rather you send an email in your own words.
          Click the button below and it’ll open an email draft with a few prompts to get you started.

          Please include your age (21+ only), general area, and a sentence or two about how cannabis helps you.
          Share only what you’re comfortable with. No medical records needed or wanted.

          This project is small, and I can’t promise I’ll always have flower available or be able
          to help everyone who reaches out. I also can’t give medical advice or tell you what
          you should do with your health—please talk to a licensed professional for that part.
