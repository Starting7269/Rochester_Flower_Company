          If you rely on cannabis to get through the day but the price tag keeps fighting you,
          you're exactly the kind of person I had in mind when I built this grow.

          There's no big intake form here on purpose. I'd rather you send an email in your own words.
          Click the button below and it'll open an email draft with a few prompts to get you started.

        <p class="footer-small" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
          Please include your age (21+ only), general area in the Rochester region, and a sentence or two about how cannabis helps you.
          Share only what you're comfortable with. No medical records needed or wanted.
        </p>

        <div class="notice" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
          <p><strong>What to expect after you reach out:</strong></p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
            Expect a conversation—not a transaction. I'm looking for people who genuinely rely on cannabis as medicine, 
            not folks building a stash. This is a garden, not a dispensary, and I can't help everyone who asks.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0.75rem;">
            This project is small, and I can't promise I'll always have flower available or be able
            to help everyone who reaches out. I also can't give medical advice or tell you what
            you should do with your health—please talk to a licensed professional for that part.

        <div style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
          <h3 style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">How do I get in touch?</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
            Use the email button above. Please include your age (21+ only), general location, and how cannabis helps you. 
            Keep it conversational—this is a person, not a dispensary.
          </p>

          <h3 style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">What strains do you grow?</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
            It varies by season and seed availability. Check the Plants page for current runs. I prioritize genetics 
            from reputable breeders over specific strain requests.
          </p>

          <h3 style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Do you deliver?</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
            This is a small, personal operation. Logistics are worked out case-by-case for those in the Rochester area 
            who genuinely benefit from what I'm growing.
          </p>

          <h3 style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Can I pay you or donate?</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
            No. This follows NY's gifting laws—no payment, trades, or exchanges of value for cannabis. 
            If you want to support the garden itself, visit the Support page.
          </p>

          <h3 style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Is this legal?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes. NY allows adults 21+ to gift cannabis to other adults without compensation under personal cultivation 
            laws (NY Penal Law § 222.05). This isn't a business—it's a personal garden.

        Rochester Flower Company is a personal, small-scale home grow operating in Rochester, NY and surrounding areas. 
        All cannabis is gifted at no cost and only to adults 21+, consistent with New York personal cultivation laws 
        (NY Penal Law § 222.05). Recipients must also be compliant with local possession laws. No sales, transactions, 
        or commercial activity occur. All information is for educational and entertainment purposes only and should not
