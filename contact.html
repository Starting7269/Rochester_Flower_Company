          <p>
            I'm at capacity right now and <strong>not accepting requests for flower</strong>. I'm also not keeping a waitlist.

            If you're reaching out about becoming a recipient, I won't be able to respond—I simply don't have the bandwidth 
            to help everyone who asks, and I can't make promises about future availability.

              No. I'm at capacity and not taking on new people. I'm also not keeping a waitlist or tracking names

            <p>
              It varies by season and seed availability. Check the Plants page for current runs. I prioritize genetics 
              from reputable breeders over specific strain requests.

              Yes. If you have a legitimate business proposal, collaboration opportunity, or professional question about 
              the operation, feel free to use this form. I can't respond to everything, but I do read business-related messages.

            </h3>
            <p>
              Yes. NY allows adults 21+ to gift cannabis to other adults without compensation under personal cultivation 
              laws (NY Penal Law § 222.05). This isn't a business—it's a personal garden.
