          <h2>Indoor Environment &amp; Medium</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Indoor tents. I use one tent for growing, another for drying.</li> 
            <li>LED lights tuned for cannabis.</li>
            <li>Under-canopy LED lighting to increase yield and reduce larf.</li>
            <li>50/50 mix of coco coir + perlite for a fast, oxygen-rich root zone. I'm injecting air to the roots via a pump, so a traditional 70/30 mix isn't an option.</li>
            <li>Self-watering SIP system with air domes so the roots never have to guess about water or air.</li>
            <li>Swivel fans to circulate air.</li>
            <li>An exhaust fan for negative air exchange and an intake fan for positive air exchange.</li>
            <li>A heater for cold NY winters and an AC to ensure hot NY summers don't harm the plants.</li>
            <li>A humidifier and dehumidifier to ensure proper vapor pressure deficit and to prevent mold.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The idea is simple: give the plant a stable, predictable world so it can
            focus on being its best self instead of surviving my mistakes.
          </p>

        <div>
          <h2>Outdoor Environment &amp; Medium</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>70/30 mix of soil base and perlite.</li> 
            <li>Mother nature provides the lighting.</li>
            <li>Environment is out of my control. If a major storm is coming I may try to protect the plants, but otherwise 
              I let nature take the wheel.</li>
            <li>Fabric pots.</li>
            <li>Bottom feed wicking system.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Outdoor is interesting because you can control less, so you're doing a lot of precautionary work you wouldn't do indoors.
            For example, I may use copper strips around my pots outside to keep slugs and snails away. It's also much cheaper—no tent, no lights, no AC, no heater, no fans. 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>Feeding &amp; General Plant Care</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Balanced, cannabis-focused nutrients with a "less but consistent" mindset. I'm constantly trying new brands and approaches—if you know a brand, I've probably used it.</li>
            <li>Monitor pH, EC, and VPD (Temp + Relative Humidity).</li>
            <li>Measuring and adjusting Daily Light Integral to ensure the plants are getting the exact amount of photons.</li>
            <li>Gentle training—no plant torture, just shaping for light penetration and airflow.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I'm always trying to hit that sweet spot where the plants look happy,
            not stressed, and the leaves are praying but not screaming.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h2>Genetics</h2>
          <p>
            This is by far one of the most important factors and also one of the most ignored. <strong>Buy great genetics.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Think of it like this: you can have the perfect growing environment, dial in every metric, and still end up with mediocre flower if you start with subpar genetics. Conversely, great genetics are remarkably forgiving.
          </p>
          <p>
            I only grow seeds from reputable, well-known breeders. I never grow white-label freebies. I never grow "my aunt found this in a bag" seeds. You can cheap out on a lot of things, but genetics should not be one of them. Find a well-known, well-trusted company that lab tests their genetics and use them.
          </p>
          <p>
            I prefer to buy directly from breeders when I can. Seed banks are perfectly fine too, but purchasing straight from the breeder puts more money in their pocket, gives you earlier access to new drops, often comes with freebie seeds, and usually means you're getting fresher stock with better germination rates.

          <h2>Drying</h2>
          <p>
            When it's chop time, plants get hung whole in a separate, controlled space.
            I aim for around <strong>60°F and 60% relative humidity</strong> as often as real life allows.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fast, hot dries are harsh and sad. Slow, cool dries keep terpenes and
            make the smoke something your lungs don't resent you for.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Curing</h2>
          <p>
            Once the outsides feel dry and the stems give that "almost snap," I buck the
            flower down and move it into Grove Bag curing containers in a stable, cool environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is where everything smooths out and the flower becomes something you
            actually want to smoke, not just "technically dried plant matter."
          </p>

    <section class="section">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Why bother with all this?</h2>
        <p>
          Because the people who end up with this flower are using it for real things:
          sleep, pain, anxiety, appetite, and occasionally just "a fun Saturday." They deserve something
          grown with intention, not whatever was left over on a bulk pallet, stuffed with chemicals you'd
          never touch otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
          Craft doesn't mean perfect. It just means I'm trying as hard as I can to make
          every run better than the last.
