        <p>
          Short version: way too much effort for the tiny amount of flower that leaves this room.
          Long version: keep scrolling.

          <h2>Environment & medium</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Indoor tents with LED lighting tuned for cannabis.</li>
            <li>Coco coir + perlite for a fast, oxygen-rich root zone.</li>
            <li>Autopots and air domes so the roots never have to guess about water or air.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The idea is simple: give the plant a stable, predictable world so it can
            focus on being its best self instead of surviving my mistakes.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>Feeding & general plant babysitting</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Balanced, cannabis-focused nutrients with a “less but consistent” mindset.</li>
            <li>Monitor pH, EC, and VPD like a complete nerd.</li>
            <li>Gentle training—no plant torture, just shaping for light and airflow.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I’m always trying to hit that sweet spot where the plants look happy,
            not stressed, and the leaves are praying but not screaming.

          <h2>Drying</h2>
          <p>
            When it’s chop time, plants get hung whole in a separate, controlled space.
            I aim for around <strong>60°F and 60% relative humidity</strong> as often as real life allows.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fast, hot dries are harsh and sad. Slow, cool dries keep terpenes and
            make the smoke something your lungs don’t resent you for.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Curing</h2>
          <p>
            Once the outsides feel dry and the stems give that “almost snap,” I buck the
            flower down and move it into curing containers in a stable, cool environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is where everything smooths out and the flower becomes something you
            actually want in a jar, not just “technically dried plant matter.”
          </p>

        <h2>Why bother with all this?</h2>
        <p>
          Because the people who end up with this flower are using it for real things:
          sleep, pain, anxiety, appetite, not just “a fun Saturday.” They deserve something
          grown with intention, not whatever was left over on a bulk pallet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Craft doesn’t mean perfect. It just means I’m trying as hard as I can to make
          every run better than the last.
