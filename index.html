          <h1>Small-Batch Craft Cannabis.<br>Grown by a normal person.</h1>
          <p>
            I’m a one-person grow in Rochester, NY with a couple of tents,
            too many spreadsheets, and a soft spot for people who genuinely need
            cannabis as a medicine.
          </p>
          <p>
            I grow medicine-grade flower in tiny batches and gift it to adults who
            actually use it as medicine. No storefront, no menu, no hype—just plants,
            care, and community.

          <h2>Why this exists</h2>
          <p>
            Some people use cannabis the same way other folks use an inhaler, a heating pad,
            or a good night’s sleep: it keeps them functional and sane. Then the prices hit,
            and suddenly their “medicine” is a luxury item.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rochester Flower Company is my way of pushing back a little: grow small, grow clean,
            and quietly hand good flower to people who actually need it.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>How I grow</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Indoor</strong> tents, coco/perlite, dialed-in LEDs, controlled temp/RH, and a very unhealthy
            love of VPD charts. 
            </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Outdoor</strong> soil/perlite. Mother Nature handles lighting and environment
            and I keep them fed and watered.
            </p>
          <p>
            All plants are slow dried, cured properly, and I obsess over the details most
            people never see—but definitely feel.

          <h3>The human behind the plants</h3>
          <p>
            RFC isn’t a “brand team.” It’s just me, my wife, our very spoiled pets, 
            and a home grow that got a little out of hand in the best way possible.

          <h3>How the grow works</h3>
          <p>
            Indoor tents, coco/perlite, LEDs, controlled temp and humidity, slow dry, real cure.
            Less marketing talk, more “here’s exactly what I’m doing and why.”

        <article class="card">
          <h3>Plants, not product shots</h3>
          <p>
            A living gallery of current runs and past favorites. Less “marketing,” more
            “look at this leaf, I’m losing my mind.”
