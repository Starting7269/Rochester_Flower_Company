          <p>
            I'm a home grower in Rochester, NY with a couple of tents, way too many spreadsheets, 
            and a genuine commitment to people who rely on medicinal plants.
          </p>
          <p>
            I grow clean, slow-cured flower in small batches and gift it to adults 21+ who truly benefit from it. 
            No storefront. No hype. No pressure. No transaction required. Just plants, craft, and community.
          </p>

        <h2 id="why-section">Why This Exists</h2>
        <p>
          Some people use plants the same way other folks use an inhaler, a heating pad,
          or a good night's sleep: it keeps them functional and sane. Then the prices hit,
          and suddenly their "medicine" is a luxury item.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rochester Flower Company is my way of pushing back: grow small, grow clean,
          and share good flower with people who genuinely need it—not just want it.

          <h3>The Person Behind the Plants</h3>
          <p>
            RFC isn't a "brand team." It's just me, my wife, our very spoiled pets, 
            and a home grow that got a little out of hand in the best way possible.

          <h3>How the Grow Works</h3>
          <p>
            Indoor tents, coco/perlite, LEDs, controlled temp and humidity, slow dry, real cure.
            Less marketing talk, more "here's exactly what I'm doing and why."
