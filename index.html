          <h1>Small-Batch Craft Cannabis.<br>Grown by a normal dude, not a corporation.</h1>
          <p>
            I’m a one-person grow in Rochester, NY with a couple of tents,
            too many spreadsheets, and a soft spot for people who genuinely need
            cannabis but can’t always swing dispensary prices.
          </p>
          <p>
            I grow medicine-grade flower in tiny batches and gift it to adults who
            actually use it as medicine. No storefront, no menu, no hype—just plants,
            care, and community.

            I don’t sell cannabis. Everything is gifted, not sold, and only to adults 21+ in line

          <h2>Why this exists</h2>
          <p>
            Some people use cannabis the same way other folks use an inhaler, a heating pad,
            or a good night’s sleep: it keeps them functional and sane. Then the prices hit,
            and suddenly their “medicine” is a luxury item.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rochester Flower Company is my way of pushing back a little: grow small, grow clean,
            and quietly hand good flower to people who actually need it.

          <h2>How I grow</h2>
          <p>
            Indoor tents, coco/perlite, dialed-in LEDs, controlled temp/RH, and a very unhealthy
            love of VPD charts. I dry slow, cure properly, and obsess over the details most
            people never see—but definitely feel.

            RFC isn’t a “brand team.” It’s just me, my partner, a very important bulldog,
            and a grow that got out of hand in the best way.

          <h3>How the grow works</h3>

            Environmental control, medium, nutrients, drying, curing—it’s all intentional.
