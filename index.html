          <h1>Small Batch Craft Cannabis,<br>Grown by Someone Who Genuinely Cares.</h1>
          <p>
            I’m a home grower in Rochester, NY with a couple of tents, too many notes, 
            and a soft spot for people who rely on medicinal plants.
          </p>
          <p>
            I grow clean, slow-cured flower in small batches and gift it to adults 21+ who truly benefit from it. 
            <br>No storefront. No hype. No pressure. Just plants, craft, and community.

            I don’t sell anything. Everything is gifted, not sold, and only gifted to adults 21+ in compliance

          <h2>Why this exists</h2>
          <p>
            Some people use plants the same way other folks use an inhaler, a heating pad,
            or a good night’s sleep: it keeps them functional and sane. Then the prices hit,
            and suddenly their “medicine” is a luxury item.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rochester Flower Company is my way of pushing back a little: grow small, grow clean,
            and quietly hand good flower to people who actually need it.
          </p>

        <div>
          <h2>How I grow</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Indoor</strong> tents, coco/perlite, dialed-in LEDs, controlled temp/RH, and a very unhealthy
            love of VPD charts. 
            </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Outdoor</strong> soil/perlite. Mother Nature handles lighting and environment
            and I keep them fed and watered.
            </p>
          <p>
            All plants are slow dried, cured properly, and I obsess over the details most
            people never see but definitely taste and feel.

          <h3>How the grow works</h3>
          <p>
            Indoor tents, coco/perlite, LEDs, controlled temp and humidity, slow dry, real cure.
            Less marketing talk, more “here’s exactly what I’m doing and why.”
