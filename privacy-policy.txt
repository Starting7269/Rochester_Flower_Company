PRIVACY POLICY UPDATE - CONTACT FORM SECTION
============================================

Replace the old FormSubmit section with this:

---

## Contact Form

When you submit a message through our contact form, your information is processed as follows:

**What We Collect:**
- Name
- Email address
- Subject line
- Message content

**How We Process It:**
We use Cloudflare Workers to process contact form submissions. Cloudflare Workers act as a secure intermediary that:
- Validates your form data
- Sends the email to our business email address
- Does not store your submission data

Your message is sent directly to our inbox and is not retained by any third-party form processing service.

**Email Delivery:**
Form submissions are delivered via MailChannels, a transactional email service. MailChannels processes the email only for delivery purposes and does not store message content beyond what's necessary for delivery (typically a few minutes).

**Your Data:**
- Contact form submissions are received in our email inbox
- We retain emails according to normal business email retention practices
- We do not share contact form submissions with third parties
- You can request deletion of your contact form submission by emailing us

---

REMOVE THESE LINES (if they exist in your current privacy policy):
- Any mention of "FormSubmit"
- Any mention of "FormSubmit.co"
- Any references to FormSubmit's privacy policy

---

OPTIONAL: Add this to your Third-Party Services section:

**Cloudflare Workers:**
We use Cloudflare Workers to process contact form submissions securely. Workers run on Cloudflare's edge network and do not store form data. See Cloudflare's privacy policy at https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/

**MailChannels:**
Contact form emails are delivered using MailChannels' transactional email service. MailChannels processes emails only for delivery and does not store message content. See MailChannels' privacy policy at https://www.mailchannels.com/privacy-policy/
