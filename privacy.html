        <p>
          This isn't a data harvesting operation. I'm just one person with some tents and plants. 
          Here's what happens to your information when you contact me.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="container narrow">
        <h2>What Information I Collect</h2>
        <p>
          If you use the contact form, I collect what you give me:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your name</li>
          <li>Your email address</li>
          <li>Whatever you write in the message field</li>
          <li>Technical information: Your IP address and browser user agent (collected automatically for security and record-keeping)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I also use sessionStorage (browser-based, temporary) to remember that you've verified your age. 
          This clears automatically when you close your browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's it. I don't use cookies, tracking pixels, or analytics scripts beyond basic Cloudflare security features.

    <section class="section section-alt">
      <div class="container narrow">
        <h2>How I Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>
          Your contact information is used for:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Responding to your message</strong> - the primary purpose</li>
          <li><strong>Legal compliance and record-keeping</strong> - contact form submissions are stored for business record-keeping purposes and potential legal compliance in the cannabis industry</li>
          <li><strong>Security</strong> - IP addresses help identify spam and abuse</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I don't:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sell your information</li>
          <li>Share it with third parties (except the services mentioned below that process the form)</li>
          <li>Use it for marketing</li>
          <li>Add you to email lists without permission</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

        <h2>How Your Data is Stored</h2>
        <p>
          When you submit the contact form, here's what happens:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Submission processing:</strong> Your form data is processed by a Cloudflare Worker (a secure serverless function running on Cloudflare's network)</li>
          <li><strong>Email notification:</strong> I receive an email notification via Resend (email delivery service)</li>
          <li><strong>Permanent storage:</strong> Your submission is stored in a private GitHub repository as a CSV record for business and legal record-keeping purposes</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          <strong>Important:</strong> Unlike typical contact forms that delete data after sending an email, 
          your submission is permanently stored in a private repository. This is for legal protection and business 
          record-keeping in the cannabis industry, where documentation of communications can be important.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="section section-alt">
      <div class="container narrow">
        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
          I use these services to make the contact form work:
        </p>
        
        <h3>Cloudflare Workers (Form Processing)</h3>
        <p>
          Contact form submissions are processed through Cloudflare Workers, a serverless computing platform. 
          The Worker runs on Cloudflare's secure network and handles form validation, email sending, and data storage.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cloudflare Privacy Policy</a>
        </p>

        <h3>Resend (Email Delivery)</h3>
        <p>
          Email notifications are sent using Resend, a transactional email service. 
          Resend processes your name, email, and message to deliver the notification to me, 
          but does not permanently store your data.
        </p>

        </p>

        <h3>GitHub (Data Storage)</h3>
        <p>
          Contact form submissions are stored in a private GitHub repository for record-keeping purposes. 
          GitHub provides the storage infrastructure, but only I have access to this private repository. 
          Your data is stored as structured CSV records.

        </p>

        <h3>Cloudflare (Security & DNS)</h3>
        <p>
          The entire site uses Cloudflare for security, DDoS protection, and DNS management. 
          They may collect technical information like IP addresses for security purposes.
        </p>

        </p>

        <h3>GitHub Pages (Hosting)</h3>
        <p>
          The website is hosted on GitHub Pages. They may collect technical information for service operation.

        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Contact form submissions:</strong> Stored indefinitely in a private GitHub repository for business 
          record-keeping and legal compliance purposes. This is intentional and necessary for operating in the cannabis 
          industry where documentation of communications may be legally relevant.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Age verification:</strong> Stored in your browser's sessionStorage only. Automatically deleted when 
          you close your browser. Not transmitted or stored on any server.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Email notifications:</strong> Retained in my email inbox according to my email retention practices. 
          Typically deleted or archived after the inquiry is resolved.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want your contact form submission deleted from the GitHub repository, see "Your Rights" below.
        </p>

      <div class="container narrow">
        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>
            You can request that I delete your contact form submission from my records 
            by contacting me. Note that I may need to retain certain records for 
            legal compliance.

    <section class="section">

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>
          I take reasonable precautions to protect your information:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>HTTPS encryption:</strong> Your connection to the site is secure</li>
          <li><strong>Cloudflare security:</strong> DDoS protection, Web Application Firewall, and security headers</li>
          <li><strong>Private repository:</strong> Contact form data is stored in a private GitHub repository with access restricted to me only</li>
          <li><strong>API key authentication:</strong> All connections between services use secure API keys</li>
          <li><strong>Spam protection:</strong> Honeypot fields and rate limiting to prevent abuse</li>
          <li><strong>Minimal data collection:</strong> I only collect what's necessary</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          That said, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure. 
          Don't send me your Social Security number, credit card info, passwords, or other sensitive personal data. 
          The contact form is for basic business inquiries, not sensitive information.
        </p>

      <div class="container narrow">
        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          This site is for adults 21 and older only. I don't knowingly collect information from anyone under 21.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're under 21, you shouldn't be here, and you definitely shouldn't be filling out the contact form.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I become aware that someone under 21 has submitted the contact form, I will delete their information immediately.

        <h2>Why I Store Contact Form Data</h2>
        <p>
          You might wonder why I permanently store contact form submissions when many websites don't. Here's why:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Legal protection:</strong> In the cannabis industry, having records of all communications can be important for demonstrating compliance with gifting laws and responding to any legal inquiries</li>
          <li><strong>Business records:</strong> Documentation of inquiries, partnerships, and business communications</li>
          <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> I'd rather be upfront about keeping records than pretend I delete everything</li>
          <li><strong>Spam tracking:</strong> Identifying patterns of abuse or spam attempts</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This is a small personal operation, not a corporation. The data is stored in a private repository 
          that only I can access. I'm not analyzing it, selling it, or doing anything with it beyond what's described here.

        <p>
          If you have questions about this privacy policy or how I handle your information, 
          you can reach me through the <a href="contact.html">contact form</a> (yes, the irony is noted) 
          or find another way to reach me if you prefer not to use the form.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm just one person running a home grow, not a legal department, but I'll do my best to answer your questions 
          and handle your data responsibly.
