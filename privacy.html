        <p>
          This isn't a data harvesting operation. I'm just one person with some tents and plants. 
          Here's what happens to your information when you contact me.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <div class="container narrow">
        <h2>What Information I Collect</h2>
        <p>
          If you use the contact form, I collect what you give me:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your name</li>
          <li>Your email address</li>
          <li>Your phone number (if provided)</li>
          <li>Your location (general area)</li>
          <li>Whatever you write in the message field</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I also use sessionStorage (browser-based, temporary) to remember that you've verified your age. 
          This clears automatically when you close your browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's it. I don't use cookies, tracking pixels, analytics scripts, or any of that stuff.
        </p>

    </section>

    <section class="section section-alt">
      <div class="container narrow">
        <h2>How I Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>
          Your contact information is used for exactly one thing: responding to your message.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don't:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sell your information</li>
          <li>Share it with third parties (except the ones mentioned below)</li>
          <li>Use it for marketing</li>
          <li>Add you to email lists</li>
          <li>Store it in databases</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Once I've responded to your inquiry, I delete your information unless there's a specific 
          reason to keep it (like ongoing conversation or a business relationship).

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
          I use a few services to make the website work:
        </p>
        
        <h3>FormSubmit (Form Processing)</h3>
        <p>
          When you submit the contact form, it goes through FormSubmit.co to reach my email. 
          They handle the submission and send it to me. I don't control their servers or their practices.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://formsubmit.co/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FormSubmit Privacy Policy</a>
        </p>

        <h3>Cloudflare (Security & DNS)</h3>
        <p>
          My site uses Cloudflare for security, DDoS protection, and DNS management. 
          They may collect technical information like IP addresses for security purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cloudflare Privacy Policy</a>
        </p>

        <h3>GitHub Pages (Hosting)</h3>
        <p>
          The website is hosted on GitHub Pages. They may collect technical information for service operation.
        </p>

      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="section section-alt">
      <div class="container narrow">
        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
          Contact form submissions: I keep them until your inquiry is resolved, then delete them. 
          Usually that's a few days or weeks at most.
        </p>
        <p>
          Age verification: Stored in your browser's sessionStorage only. Automatically deleted when you close your browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everything else: There is no "everything else." I'm not running analytics or storing logs beyond 
          what my hosting provider does for basic operations.
        </p>

    <section class="section">
      <div class="container narrow">
        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>
          You have the right to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Request deletion:</strong> Email me and I'll delete your information immediately</li>
          <li><strong>Request access:</strong> Ask what information I have about you (probably just an email thread)</li>
          <li><strong>Correct information:</strong> If I got something wrong, let me know</li>
          <li><strong>Opt out:</strong> Just don't use the contact form</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Since I'm not storing information in databases or using it for ongoing purposes, 
          these rights are pretty straightforward.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="section section-alt">
      <div class="container narrow">
        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>
          I take reasonable precautions to protect your information:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>HTTPS encryption (your connection to the site is secure)</li>
          <li>Cloudflare's security features (DDoS protection, WAF)</li>
          <li>FormSubmit's security measures (for form processing)</li>
          <li>No plain text storage of sensitive information</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          That said, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure. 
          Don't send me your Social Security number, credit card info, or anything like that. 
          The contact form is for basic inquiries, not sensitive data.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <div class="container narrow">
        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          This site is for adults 21 and older only. I don't knowingly collect information from anyone under 21.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're under 21, you shouldn't be here, and you definitely shouldn't be filling out the contact form.
        </p>

      <div class="container narrow">
        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>
          If I make changes to this privacy policy, I'll update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm not planning on making this more complicated than it needs to be, 
          but if something changes with how the site works, I'll update this accordingly.
        </p>

          If you have questions about this privacy policy or how I handle your information, 
          you can reach me through the <a href="contact.html">contact form</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm just one person running a home grow, not a legal department, but I'll do my best to answer your questions.
