          Rochester Flower Company is a small personal home grow in Rochester, NY. There's no storefront,
          no menu, and no checkout. It's just me, a couple of tents, way too many spreadsheets, and a genuine 
          commitment to people who rely on cannabis as medicine.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you enjoy the photos, the nerdy details, or the idea of making good flower a little more
          accessible, you can chip in to help keep the garden going.

        <p>
          Donations don't turn this into a business. They just make it a little easier to keep doing this
          the right way instead of the cheap way.

          <p>
            Rochester Flower Company is a personal, small-scale home grow in New York. Cannabis is
            <strong>not sold</strong> here. If cannabis is ever gifted, it is only:
          </p>
          <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">
            <li>To adults 21+ under New York's personal use and gifting rules</li>
            <li>Without any payment, trade, service, or other exchange of value for the flower itself</li>
            <li>In places where possession is legal (not in schools or other restricted locations)</li>
            <li>To recipients who are also compliant with local laws</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Any money you send via Buy Me a Coffee is a <strong>voluntary donation to support the garden and content</strong>,
            not payment for cannabis, products, or services. This is crucial: donations support the project (seeds, soil, lights, 
            documentation), not the cannabis itself.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0.75rem;">
            No medical advice is offered, and nothing here is meant to diagnose, treat, or cure anything. 
            I'm not a doctor—talk to a licensed healthcare professional about whether cannabis is right for you.
          </p>

            Nothing on this page is legal or financial advice – it's just one home grower being transparent about
            what this project is and isn't.
