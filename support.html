          Rochester Flower Company is a tiny personal home grow in Rochester, NY. There’s no storefront,
          no menu, and no checkout. It’s just me, a couple of tents, too many notes, and a soft spot for
          people who actually use cannabis as medicine.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you enjoy the photos, the nerdy details, or the idea of making good flower a little more
          accessible, you can chip in to help keep the garden going.
        </p>

          Donations don’t turn this into a business. They just make it a little easier to keep doing this
          the right way instead of the cheap way.

        <ul>
          <li>New genetics, seeds, and clones for future runs</li>
